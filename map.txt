Python’s Map built-in function: perform function on iterables
	When using map built-in function in python you have to create a function first then use the map() method which performs a specific given function on an iterable mostly lists.
	Map takes two arguments, a function and an iterable i.e
Map(function, list)
The function may be created before the map (with def) or inside the map (with lambda)**Note: if you need a tutorial on functions, you can check my python post lists**
Example 1:
	Program to get squares of a list on numbers
	Solution
	# In this case we will use lambda because we are dealing with a function that has only one statement
	>>> print(map(lambda x: x**2, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))
	>>> map object
	#By the way map returns an object that can also be iterated upon
	>>> for i in map(lambda x: x**2, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]):
	>>>	print(i)
	>>>    1
		4
		9
		16
		25
		36
		49
		64
		81
	# Or you can define a function first
	def Square(x):
		return x**2
	for i in map(Square, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]):
		print(i)
	#This program still does the same thing as the above program
	**NOTE** Map is not only for mathematical operations, as long as you want to work on an iterable it is a go.
EXCERCISES (use map with or without other logics):
Create a program that solves the cubes of a list  of numbers from 1-20
Create a program that returns the middle character of a list of  odd length words. E.g [“cat”,”carpets”,”mushrooms”]
Create a program that returns the splited version of the any list of lists e.g [[“My name is python”],[“Python is the best”]] will return
[‘My’,’name’,‘is’,‘python’]
[‘Python’ ,‘is’ ,‘the’ ,‘best’]

Play with the above exercises and give yourself problems to solve.
